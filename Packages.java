/*
     If youâ€™re using IntelliJ, it handles packages automatically.
Just make sure:
Student.java is inside a folder called mypackage
Main.java is outside or in another appropriate folder
You import the package properly

Def : 
package is just like a folder.
We put Student.java inside it, and then use import to bring that into Main.java.
This helps keep code clean and reusable, especially in big projects.
